# Projects 🚀:
* Egypt Trains (live: https://egtrains.vercel.app )
    - Egypt Trains is the first web app in Egypt for train schedules, I made this app to help web users search and find the proper train trip from hundreds of options daily.
    - I built this app from scratch, both frontend and backend, which was a very rich experience for me because it leveraged a lot of what I can do.
    - My utilized technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript,MUI,Firebase, and MongoDB.
* Consulting (live : https://aymanmorsy.github.io/consulting )
    - Consulting is a responsive landing page that I converted from PSD to a live website using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
